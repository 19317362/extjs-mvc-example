Pros/Cons
Pros
Comprehensive front-end development solution
Class system, MVC framework, UI widgets, charts and graphs, cross browser support, build tools (Sencha Cmd / Sencha Architect / Eclipse Plugin)
Virtualized grids - only virtualized on the rows though
Cons
High learning curve - with commercial vendor lock in!
Best if you (or your team) are quite comfortable with JavaScript first
Theming is a labor intensive process - themes were not easily portable until recently (4.2)
Comprehensive front-end development solution
Once you're in, you're all in
Difficult to integrate into existing applications - documentation centers on new implementations
Does not play well with others, e.g. jQuery - source?
Bloat - "ext-all.js" is around 2 MB (!) minified
Requires discipline to configure builds properly to construct a minimal, single source file for an application
Performance - While improving, still renders a LOT of DOM elements for simple widgets (e.g. a button)
